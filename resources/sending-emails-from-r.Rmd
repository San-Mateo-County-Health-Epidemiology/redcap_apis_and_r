# Overview

There are many use cases for sending emails from R. It's especially useful when you're scheduling a script, as it allows you to receive an email confirmation that the script ran and to receive a summary of what the script did, ie. how many records were processed, important values, etc. 

There are likely many ways to send emails from R, but we typically use two packages [`sendmailR`](https://github.com/olafmersmann/sendmailR) and [`blastula`](https://github.com/rstudio/blastula). `sendmailR` is great for plain text emails and `blastula` is good for rich text emails. 

This overview will provide basic examples for how to use these packages. Additionaly information is available at the links above and on the internet.
