# REDCap APIs and R

This repo contains [slides](https://elizabethjump.github.io/redcap_apis_and_r/#/title-slide) and resources to explain our workflow of managing daily ED Census data in REDCap. While the data are stored in REDCap, the data processing, importing and visualizing is done from R. 

A general outline of the workflow is in the slides and an outline of the code is [here](https://github.com/elizabethjump/redcap_apis_and_r/blob/main/resources/workflow-outline.R).
